# solar-system-3d

A simple, out-of-scale 3D simulation of the solar system.


## Controls:

**Left stick**: Moves the camera on the horizontal.

**Right stick**: Rotates the camera.

**Touchpad**: Pauses and resumes the simulation.

**Cross**: Enables/disables the display of planetary orbits.

**R1**: Enables/disables sunlight.

**L1**: Enables/disables the display of constellations and the Milky Way belt in shades of blue.


## Stars:

The sky features 7,000 [real stars](stars.txt) visible to the naked eye, mapped from the [SIMBAD Astronomical Database](https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/). Their sizes and colors vary according to their magnitude. I used the [Stellarium](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium) software to identify the stars that make up each constellation, and the constellation designs are identical to those found in Stellarium. Honestly I'm surprised by the accuracy of the results obtained!

## Available Constellations:

Currently, the available constellations are: Aries, Gemini, Leo, Scorpius, Pegasus, Andromeda, Orion, Crux, Phoenix, Auriga, Cygnus, Dragon, Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Libra, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Pisces, Aquarius, Canis Major, Canis Minor, Cassiopeia, Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Lupus, Chamaeleon, Aquila, Hercules and Perseus.
